# Coinpot Faucet Utility
A small chrome extension that allows the user to easily launch all faucet sites connected to CoinPot. Also comes with extra goodies that tackle the anti-adblocker.

## What's included?
- A simple window that allows the user to choose up to 7 faucet websites that pay out to CoinPot!
- Some anti-adblocking code

## Installation instructions:
1. Download the source or the packaged release.
2. Extract the files into a folder of your choice.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click on `Load Unpacked`.
4. Select the folder that the files are in.

> "Why don't you upload the extension to the Chrome Webstore?"
